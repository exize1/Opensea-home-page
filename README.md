# [Opensea (Home page)](https://myopensea.netlify.app/)

Opensea is the biggest online marketplace for NFTs. The company started its journey in 2017, back in the days when NFT wasn't something you hear a lot, if not at all. But in 2021, following a heightened interest in, the company's revenue reached $2.75 billion till September. By January 2022, the company had been valued at $13.3 billion and has been considered the largest NFT marketplace. The daily trading volume on the OpenSea marketplace reached a record $2.7 billion on May 1, 2022, but four months later had dropped by 99%.

## Why Opensea

I think there is two main things that made me build their home page: 

Before the Fullstack course I'm taking right now, I was really into NFTs, I was trading, investing and even taking part in building a real NFT collection (which includs building community, roadmap, art and much more, but we'll keep it for another time), so I spent a lot of time on Opensea. It was clear to me the moment I was taught in the course about "Bootstap" - Opensea were built with Bootstrap! 

I was amaized by the idea of being able to build this application by myself, and with a framwork that make the UI designe so simple. So I decided to practice my UI skills with bootstrap, and build the Opensea home page outside of the course
